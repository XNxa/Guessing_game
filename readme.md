# Guessing game

## Purpose

*This is my first Rust program.* I am using it to learn the language.

## Description

This is a simple guessing game. The program will generate a random number between `min` and `max`. The user will be prompted to guess the number. If the user guesses correctly, the program will end. If the user guesses incorrectly, the program will tell the user if the guess was too high or too low. The user will then be prompted to guess again. This will continue until the user guesses correctly.
